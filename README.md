## About

This project implements a web application using Streamlit to host a Seq2Seq model for translation tasks. The Seq2Seq model architecture consists of an encoder-decoder with attention mechanism, trained on a multilingual dataset to facilitate translations between different languages.

## Features

- Translation from German to English and vice versa.
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit.
- Attention visualization for understanding model predictions.

## Demo

Include a GIF or link to a demo video showcasing your application in action.
